# playwright_pytest_show_case
python playwright pytest automation example


1. Where:
* I used the site generated by AI on wix platform: https://symonstorozhenko.wixsite.com/website-1/
* During submission of Contact Us request captcha is triggered
* If I had an option to turn it off before test case execution, I would do it
* However this option is not available for me, therefore the test with the Contact Us form submission is flaky
* I have a plan to do something with it a bit later

2. What:
* My aim is to present a project structure and automate a couple of UI cases to prove it works


3. So, the repo demonstrates understanding of project structure. In a nutshell:

'''
playwright_pytest_show_case/
├── README.md                        # here we go
├── test                             # a folder with test cases, I have here just one .py with all test cases
│   ├── test_pp.py                   # whatever happens it starts with 'test_'
├── conftest.py                      # file with fixtures, always has this name
├── page_objects.py                  # constant variables are defined here for better readability and faster changes. Name is reserved as well
├── pytest.ini                       # execution settings
'''

4. I use:
* python
* playwright
* pytest
* asyncio

5. Test cases are executed with the command: pytest --html=report.html --self-contained-html
So as a result we get a report with details and statistics

6. Let us go and check how all this lives together
